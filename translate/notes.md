きてみてもいいですか

May I try and wear it?

How is たべてから different from たべたあとで? Kaori sensei mentioned the feeling is different.

てから has a time sequence. Stronger meaning. Sequence of actions is definite. The other way around it sounds like there's a chance V2 can happen before V1, therefore shower can't happen before waking up. 

tsukemasu. This also means to put together.
