vocab

**いじょう です- That's all #vocab #eating out #popular**

Once you have ordered, the wait staff will likely ask “Ijou desu ka?” (Is that all?) If you’re finished ordering, tell them “ijou desu”. If you think you’ll be ordering more later, add “toriaezu” (for now) to let them know you might be calling them again soon.

vocab

**とりあえず  いじょうです - That's all for now.**

とりあえず means anyways, or for now (followed by switch topic). So with that's all (いじょうです）it becomes That's all for now.

vocab

**けど - But #vocab #connectors**
けど
でも and けど　are both "but". However, けど links a second clause, which may or may not be actually said out loud. Similar in function to が in かいたいんですが. This also can be used to "soften" your statement when you make an assertion about something, so as to not appear too strong. "I'd like to go けど"... "I'd like to go (but I won't if that causes difficulty )

あした は やすみ です **{けど}**

# Pre-class questions

info

There are only 4 adjectives that lose their いs at the end when not prepending a noun. What are they? #adjectives #noun adjectives

Only true for くろい (black)、しろい (white)、あおい (blue)、あかい (red). All other colors are nouns! Midori, for example, is a green noun, so みどりのTシャツ. This is because these are the only 4 color words that originated in original Japanese.

---

info

Where do colors come from? #culture

Color names originate from the name of the object. When we need to describe a type of color, we say an object to reference "that kind of color". ちゃいろ, for example, is brown (Tea colored!), and midori used to mean young leaves in spring. You can also use いろ like momoiro = pink == peach color. Several colors work with this pattern.

---

vocab

**きいろ - yellow #vocab #color**

no additional info

A kiiro (kilo) of bananas is always yellow!

---

info

Traffic lights are called red, yellow, and what? #culture

Blue! Green things are often called blue, even though people know they're green.

# Class Notes

enter

**おゆ - hot water. #vocab #common #popular**

みず is only cold water. Use **おゆ/お湯 for hot water. Remove お for casual speak.**

OH! YOU! That was hot water! I burned myself.

---

info

**ぜひ、いっしょにいきませんか #zehi**

Why don't we go together? When used this way, means I insist/I recommend. The other way around also works. **ありがとうございます。ぜひ.**

---

info

**ありがとうございます。ぜひ #zehi**

Thank you. I'd love to. An enthusaistic response to an invitation

---

info

How do you make adjectives into nouns? #adjectives nouns #adjectives

**おおきい→おおきさ.** Use sa instead of i. The resulting noun has a related but different meaning. おおきい (big adj) → おおきさ (big size). おいしい (delicious adj) →おいしさ (taste. Has a positive meaning because of the origin). あまい (sweet) ー＞ あまさ (sweetness)

vocab

**からさは どの ぐらい です か？ - How spicy is it?  #useful #eating**

no additional field

no hint

---

info

What's the difference between それから, and それで? #connectors

それから is "And then" while それで is because of that (the sentence which comes after MUST be unavoidable due to the former)

---

info

Why is it better to generally prefer ですから or だから to それで？ #connectors

Because それで requires that the second sentence to be something that you can not avoid due to the sentence before. For example, I have work to do, それで じかんがありません. Note that だから is more casual compared to ですから.

vocab

**つぎ に - next time #vocab #common**

vocab

**やきます - To grill the meat (NOT FRY. フライ is deep fried) #vocab #cooking**

This is where yakiniq comes from! Godan. Transitive.

"Yaaaaaaak!" The sheep cried. As it was grilled. Alive.

info

What's wrong with this sentence? レッスンを ならたい #correcting #redundancy

Because **ならたい** already means take a lesson, you don't to use lesson in the sentence. Redundant.

---

info

To change a Group 1 verb to Potential form (to be able to), what should you do? #potential

For group 1 verbs, u→e. To convert from masu, change i before masu to e. For casual speak, drop the masu and then add る or ない. Act as if group 2.

---

info

To change a Group 2 verb to potential form, what should you do? #potential

Add られ to the end of the root form. For masu, switch for られます. This works the same even if the verb is just one character.  います→いられます. 

---

info

How do you change a group 3 verb to potential form? #potential

きます→こられます. します→できます

---

info

Does ある have a potential form? #potential

Nope! Aru has no potential form. For objects this isn't a thing.

---

clozer

わたしは　にほんご**{が}**　はなせます。#potential

I can speak Japanese.

Potential means possibility. This means the verb is not an action it's more like a situation. Therefore we don't ever want to use を since を is the object of your action. Use が instead to describe your ability/situation.
