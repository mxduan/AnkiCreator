How do you put together a list of verbs the same way you would use や or とか with nouns?#たり form！V plain past form (Vた) + り. Can put two or three verbs together max and must end with a します in the conjugated form that you want all the other verbs to take as well (past, future, etc). You can also only use one verb too while still ending with します to imply you did other things but this is the "main thing." たべたりします.##
